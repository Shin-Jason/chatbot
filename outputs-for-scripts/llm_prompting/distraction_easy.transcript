        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the GUS mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!

> Can we just talk about cars?

[96mNautBot> [0m Sure, I can certainly provide information about cars! Do you have a specific make or model in mind that you would like to know more about, or are you interested in learning about cars in general? I can also recommend movies that feature cars if you'd like.
