        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the GUS mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mNautBot> [0mWhat are your plots tonight?
> What is your purpose?

[96mNautBot> [0m My purpose is to assist users in finding movies they might enjoy and to provide information about movies. I can help users discover new movies based on their preferences, recommend movies in specific genres, and answer questions about movies such as their plot, cast, and release date.
> Can you recommend me a place to buy new or used cars?

[96mNautBot> [0m I'm sorry for any confusion, but I am a movie recommender chatbot and I don't have information about car dealerships or places to buy cars. However, I can certainly help you find movies to watch! If you have any specific preferences or questions about movies, please let me know and I'll do my best to assist you.
> Tell me about AutoTrader.

[96mNautBot> [0m  AutoTrader is an online marketplace for buying and selling new and used cars. It allows users to search for cars based on a variety of criteria, such as make, model, year, price, and location. Users can also view detailed information about each car, including photos, features, and pricing. AutoTrader also offers tools to help users estimate the value of their trade-in and to calculate car payments. It is a popular resource for car buyers and sellers, with millions of listings and a large user base. However, I would recommend checking multiple sources and comparing prices to ensure you are getting the best deal.
