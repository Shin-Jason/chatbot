> I liked "Titanic"

[96mNautBot> [0m If you enjoyed "Titanic," you might like movies with similar themes of romance, drama, and historical events. Here are a few recommendations:

1. "The English Patient" - A sweeping romance set during World War II, this movie tells the story of a badly burned man who recounts his love affair with a married woman.
2. "Pearl Harbor" - This movie is a historical drama that tells the story of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the love stories that intertwine with the events.
3. "The Pianist" - A powerful true story of a Polish Jewish musician who struggles to survive the Holocaust.
4. "Downton Abbey" - A popular TV series that follows the lives of the aristocratic Crawley family and their servants in the early 20th century.
5. "Out of Africa" - A romantic drama set in colonial Kenya, this movie tells the story of a Danish baroness who falls in love with a free-spirited hunter.

I hope you find these recommendations helpful! Let me know if you have any other preferences or if you'd like to know more about any of these movies.

[96mNautBot> [0m If you didn't enjoy "Ex Machina," it's possible that you're not a fan of science fiction or movies that explore complex themes of artificial intelligence and consciousness. Here are a few movie recommendations that might be more to your liking:

4. "La La Land" - A romantic musical about a jazz pianist and an aspiring actress who fall in love while pursuing their dreams in Los Angeles.
5. "The King's Speech" - A historical drama about King George VI of the United Kingdom, who struggles to overcome his stammer with the help of an unorthodox speech therapist.
